        <h2>What is the meaning of peer evaluation?</h2>
        <p>
          Peer evaluation or assessment refers to sharing creative work with
          peers in order to obtain constructive feedback, then revising and
          improving the work accordingly. By giving and receiving feedback, peer
          evaluation or assessment helps peers understand their own work and
          improve.
        </p>
        <h2>How do you evaluate your peer?</h2>
        <p>
          During peer evaluations, I give feedback and praise in a balanced
          manner. I am honest and respectful, I reflect on their work and
          interact with them on a regular basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          By following these steps, you can help to create a positive and
          productive peer evaluation process that benefits both you and your
          peer.
        </p>
        <h2>What is the meaning of group dynamics?</h2>
        <p>
          Studies the nature, formation and reasons for forming the groups. It
          studies how groups affect the behavior and attitude of members and the
          organization. It is a process by which people interact with each
          other. If groups are effectively managed, they contribute a lot to
          organizational goals. A process by which groups interact that
          determines how they function and how effective they are. It can be
          divided into intragroup dynamics (interactions within a group) and
          intergroup dynamic (interaction between groups).
        </p>
        <h2>What is the importance of group dynamics?</h2>
        <p>
          It deals with the attitudes and patterns of behavior of an individual
          in a group. Additionally, it concerns the established structure,
          function, and procedures of group formation. Team members can quickly
          identify a group that exhibits positive dynamism. The ability to trust
          one another, to work toward a collective decision, and to hold one
          another accountable for making things happen are the most important
          aspects.
        </p>
        <h2>What makes you a good leader?</h2>
        <p>
          I believe communication is the most important quality of a good
          leader. A leader should be able to build trust within the team and
          focus on the team first. Respect is earned when great leader treat
          their teams with respect. Working with a team of people means tasks,
          goals, and responsibilities will shift. An adaptable leader can adjust
          and maintain ownership of the group, project, or meeting at hand.
        </p>
        <h2>What are the different leadership styles? (5 points)</h2>
        <p>There are 8 Types of leadership styles:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Democratic Leadership
            <p>
              Makes decisions based on the opinions and feedback of their team.
              To put it more succinctly, they involve everyone in the
              decision-making process. However, due to disadvantages such as
              losing the leader's authority, disagreements, and miscommunication
              among team members, this style of leadership cannot be utilized in
              the long run.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Autocratic Leadership
            <p>
              This is precisely the opposite of democratic leadership. Any
              business decision is made without considering the opinions of team
              members. Leaders, on the other hand, make the unrealistic
              expectation that others will follow their decisions.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Laissez-Faire Leadership
            <p>
              Laissez-faire is French for "let them do." This is the least
              intrusive option and guarantees that team members hold
              decision-making authority. Team members are given autonomy and
              held accountable for their work by this leadership style. This
              motivates many team members to put their best foot forward,
              improving the organization's efficiency and productivity.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Strategic Leadership
            <p>
              When leaders apply their abilities and skills to assist team
              members and the organization in achieving long-term objectives.
              Strategic leaders strive to make the most of situations or people.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Transformational Leadership
            <p>
              Encourage others to achieve the unimaginable. By motivating and
              encouraging others, they hope to transform and enhance the
              capabilities and functions of team members as well as
              organizations.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Transactional Leadership
            <p>
              This type of leadership is task-oriented, which means team members
              who meet the leader's expectations will be rewarded, and others
              will be punished. It is a prevalent leadership style based on the
              action-and-reward concept.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Coach-style Leadership
            <p>
              Identifying and cultivating a team member's strengths and
              weaknesses is central to this leadership style. The strategies
              that a coaching leader develops emphasize the success of team
              members. This is similar to the strategic and democratic
              leadership styles, but the individual is more important here.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Bureaucratic Leadership
            <p>
              This style of leadership follows the rules. They might, for
              instance, consider the viewpoints of the members of their team
              before making a decision.
            </p>
